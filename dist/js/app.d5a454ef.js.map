Also, in times of\r\nplay rather than work, acting spontaneously and impulsively can be\r\nfun. Impulsive individuals can be seen by others as colorful,\r\nfun-to-be-with, and zany.\r\n<br /><br />\r\nNonetheless, acting on impulse can lead to trouble in a number of\r\nways. Some impulses are antisocial. Uncontrolled antisocial acts\r\nnot only harm other members of society, but also can result in\r\nretribution toward the perpetrator of such impulsive acts. Another\r\nproblem with impulsive acts is that they often produce immediate\r\nrewards but undesirable, long-term consequences. Examples include\r\nexcessive socializing that leads to being fired from one's job,\r\nhurling an insult that causes the breakup of an important\r\nrelationship, or using pleasure-inducing drugs that eventually\r\ndestroy one's health.\r\n<br /><br />\r\nImpulsive behavior, even when not seriously destructive, diminishes\r\na person's effectiveness in significant ways. Acting impulsively\r\ndisallows contemplating alternative courses of action, some of which\r\nwould have been wiser than the impulsive choice. Impulsivity also\r\nsidetracks people during projects that require organized sequences\r\nof steps or stages. Accomplishments of an impulsive person are\r\ntherefore small, scattered, and inconsistent.\r\n<br /><br />\r\nA hallmark of intelligence, what potentially separates human beings\r\nfrom earlier life forms, is the ability to think about future\r\nconsequences before acting on an impulse. Intelligent activity\r\ninvolves contemplation of long-range goals, organizing and planning\r\nroutes to these goals, and persisting toward one's goals in the face\r\nof short-lived impulses to the contrary.

Les impulsifs peuvent être vus comme divertissants ou loufoques.  <br /><br />Néanmoins, agir sous le coup d'une impulsion peut être mauvais. Certaines impulsions sont anti-sociales. Les actes anti-sociaux non contrôlés ne blessent pas seulement des membres de la société, mais les auteurs peuvent également encourir des sanctions. Un autre souci est l'immédiateté d'un résultat pas toujours désiré ou ayant des conséquences sur le long-terme. Par exemple impliquant un licenciement, hurler et insulter sur un collègue peut causer la destruction d'une importante relation de travail ou encore l'utilisation de drogue induit un plaisir immédiat mais une détérioration de l'état de santé sur le long terme.  <br /><br />Un comportement impulsif, non destructif, peut fortement réduire l'efficacité. Agir de façon impulsive interdit les actions alternatives, qui auraient pu être envisagées. L'impulsivité peut également distraire les participants d'un projet nécessitant une organisation séquentielle. La réussite d'une personne impulsive est donc faible, éparpillée et inconsistante.  <br /><br />Une des caractéristiques de l'intelligence, ce qui potentiellement différencie l'être humain des anciennes formes de vie, est la capacité à penser aux conséquences avant d'agir sur une impulsion. Une activité intelligente implique la prise en compte de but à long terme, l'organisation et la planification des différents chemins pour arriver à ces buts pour désamorcer les impulsions à court terme. L'idée que l'intelligence implique le contrôle de ses impulsions est représentée  par l'indice de prudence, un synonyme du domaine de la Conscience.  <br /><br />Les individus ayant un score haut passent auprès des autres pour être intelligents et fiables. Les bénéfices sont indéniables. Ils évitent les soucis et réussissent à travers leur détermination et leur planification. Un des côtés négatifs, est qu'ils peuvent être compulsifs, perfectionnistes ou addictes au travail. A l'extrême ils peuvent passer pour étouffants ou ennuyeux.  <br /><br />Les individus présentant un score bas peuvent être critiqués pour leur faillibilité, leur manque d'ambition et leurs échecs à rester dans les clous, mais ils expérimenteront le plaisir du court-terme et ne seront jamais perçus comme étouffants.\",\r\n  results: [\r\n    {\r\n      score: 'low',\r\n      text: 'Votre score bas indique que vous aimez vivre le moment présent et faire ce qui vous rend heureux sur le moment.
