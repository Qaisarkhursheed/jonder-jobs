Impulsive individuals can be seen by others as colorful,\nfun-to-be-with, and zany.\n<br /><br />\nNonetheless, acting on impulse can lead to trouble in a number of\nways. Some impulses are antisocial. Uncontrolled antisocial acts\nnot only harm other members of society, but also can result in\nretribution toward the perpetrator of such impulsive acts. Another\nproblem with impulsive acts is that they often produce immediate\nrewards but undesirable, long-term consequences. Examples include\nexcessive socializing that leads to being fired from one's job,\nhurling an insult that causes the breakup of an important\nrelationship, or using pleasure-inducing drugs that eventually\ndestroy one's health.\n<br /><br />\nImpulsive behavior, even when not seriously destructive, diminishes\na person's effectiveness in significant ways. Acting impulsively\ndisallows contemplating alternative courses of action, some of which\nwould have been wiser than the impulsive choice.
