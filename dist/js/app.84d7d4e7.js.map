Occasionnellement, certaines contraintes impliquent de casser des décisions et nécessitent une action rapide, alors les impulsions sont efficaces. De plus hors du cadre du travail, lors de jeux par exemple, agir de façon spontanée et impulsive peut être amusant. Les impulsifs peuvent être vus comme divertissants ou loufoques.  <br /><br />Néanmoins, agir sous le coup d'une impulsion peut être mauvais. Certaines impulsions sont anti-sociales. Les actes anti-sociaux non contrôlés ne blessent pas seulement des membres de la société, mais les auteurs peuvent également encourir des sanctions. Un autre souci est l'immédiateté d'un résultat pas toujours désiré ou ayant des conséquences sur le long-terme. Par exemple impliquant un licenciement, hurler et insulter sur un collègue peut causer la destruction d'une importante relation de travail ou encore l'utilisation de drogue induit un plaisir immédiat mais une détérioration de l'état de santé sur le long terme.  <br /><br />Un comportement impulsif, non destructif, peut fortement réduire l'efficacité. Agir de façon impulsive interdit les actions alternatives, qui auraient pu être envisagées. L'impulsivité peut également distraire les participants d'un projet nécessitant une organisation séquentielle. La réussite d'une personne impulsive est donc faible, éparpillée et inconsistante.  <br /><br />Une des caractéristiques de l'intelligence, ce qui potentiellement différencie l'être humain des anciennes formes de vie, est la capacité à penser aux conséquences avant d'agir sur une impulsion. Une activité intelligente implique la prise en compte de but à long terme, l'organisation et la planification des différents chemins pour arriver à ces buts pour désamorcer les impulsions à court terme. L'idée que l'intelligence implique le contrôle de ses impulsions est représentée  par l'indice de prudence, un synonyme du domaine de la Conscience.  <br /><br />Les individus ayant un score haut passent auprès des autres pour être intelligents et fiables.
