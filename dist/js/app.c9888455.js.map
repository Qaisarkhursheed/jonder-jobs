Impulsive individuals can be seen by others as colorful,\r\nfun-to-be-with, and zany.\r\n<br /><br />\r\nNonetheless, acting on impulse can lead to trouble in a number of\r\nways. Some impulses are antisocial. Uncontrolled antisocial acts\r\nnot only harm other members of society, but also can result in\r\nretribution toward the perpetrator of such impulsive acts. Another\r\nproblem with impulsive acts is that they often produce immediate\r\nrewards but undesirable, long-term consequences. Examples include\r\nexcessive socializing that leads to being fired from one's job,\r\nhurling an insult that causes the breakup of an important\r\nrelationship, or using pleasure-inducing drugs that eventually\r\ndestroy one's health.\r\n<br /><br />\r\nImpulsive behavior, even when not seriously destructive, diminishes\r\na person's effectiveness in significant ways. Acting impulsively\r\ndisallows contemplating alternative courses of action, some of which\r\nwould have been wiser than the impulsive choice. Impulsivity also\r\nsidetracks people during projects that require organized sequences\r\nof steps or stages. Accomplishments of an impulsive person are\r\ntherefore small, scattered, and inconsistent.\r\n<br /><br />\r\nA hallmark of intelligence, what potentially separates human beings\r\nfrom earlier life forms, is the ability to think about future\r\nconsequences before acting on an impulse.

Occasionnellement, certaines contraintes impliquent de casser des décisions et nécessitent une action rapide, alors les impulsions sont efficaces. De plus hors du cadre du travail, lors de jeux par exemple, agir de façon spontanée et impulsive peut être amusant. Les impulsifs peuvent être vus comme divertissants ou loufoques.  <br /><br />Néanmoins, agir sous le coup d'une impulsion peut être mauvais. Certaines impulsions sont anti-sociales. Les actes anti-sociaux non contrôlés ne blessent pas seulement des membres de la société, mais les auteurs peuvent également encourir des sanctions. Un autre souci est l'immédiateté d'un résultat pas toujours désiré ou ayant des conséquences sur le long-terme. Par exemple impliquant un licenciement, hurler et insulter sur un collègue peut causer la destruction d'une importante relation de travail ou encore l'utilisation de drogue induit un plaisir immédiat mais une détérioration de l'état de santé sur le long terme.  <br /><br />Un comportement impulsif, non destructif, peut fortement réduire l'efficacité. Agir de façon impulsive interdit les actions alternatives, qui auraient pu être envisagées. L'impulsivité peut également distraire les participants d'un projet nécessitant une organisation séquentielle. La réussite d'une personne impulsive est donc faible, éparpillée et inconsistante.  <br /><br />Une des caractéristiques de l'intelligence, ce qui potentiellement différencie l'être humain des anciennes formes de vie, est la capacité à penser aux conséquences avant d'agir sur une impulsion.
